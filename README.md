# R3-SoftwareTask2-DanielAbdi

The program takes keyboard input over VNC or SSH and outputs it to motor driver program. It uses a predetermined duty cycle to control motor speed (The robot is designed to go at a singular speed in order for maximum efficiency.)
I have been unable to complete the TCP portion of the assignment due to some issues on my end getting the program to work the way I want it to. My combination of the curses and TCP modules are not working as intended. The keyboard will send output but not continuously, and will only send the new key if it is different from the last one.
